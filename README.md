# Anatomy-of-Linux


Layers of the Linux kernel “onion”. The Linux kernel is 50% device drivers, and 25% CPU-specific code. The two inner layers are very generic.

Notice that it is built as an onion and is comprised of many discrete components. The outermost layer of the diagram is device drivers, which is 50% of the code, and more than 75% of its code is hardware-specific.
